# Resume Generator AI ðŸ§ ðŸ“„

This project is an AI-powered resume objective customizer. It uses a *custom generative LSTM model* built from scratch in *PyTorch*, without any pre-trained logic, to create tailored resume objectives based on job descriptions and candidate input.

## âœ¨ Features

- Custom-built *generative AI model* (not classification-based)
- AI-generated resume objectives using:
  - User's personal info, skills, projects, certifications, etc.
  - Job description
  - Uploaded or pasted resume
- Clean dark-themed frontend with multiple resume templates
- Resume download as PDF or Word
